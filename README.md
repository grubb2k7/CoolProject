Purpose : This project is about developing a well organized database system in order to store information of employees in a company by utilizing shell script. 
Specification : A user will be able to 
input information from the command line  about each employee such as names, types of employment and salary.
The program will take the input from the command line, organize the information and put into differenet directories. The user
will be able to access information later.
The application of this project is to keep a decently organized information of employees.
Note : The program does not implement all the features desired or required by a company. The idea of this project can be utilized as a prototype for developing a bigger system, but it 
may not be used to replace a system.
